        The diseases is spreading rapidly. We are warning civilians to stay away from them, they are very dangerous and  unpredictable.
        The CDC is trying to figure out what is causing people to turn into “zombies”, it’s been reported that people are losing their skin and they are
        getting urges to eat other people who are not infected.The CDC thinks this all started with two people who were trying to create something.
        It’s not been said yet what they intended to create but we know that there were dangerous chemicals involved. Some of these included acetone,
        lithium,toluene, hydrochloric acid, pseudoephedrine, red phosphorus, sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, and anhydrous ammonia.
        They are all  highly toxic and flammable. The names of the women have been released as Crystal Angel Snow and Anna Jay Molly.
        They are going to be facing charges unless they can prove it wasn’t them.</p>

          <p>Karma is getting back at people who have done wrong. Karma is looking for people who have been rude to others.
          It’s not sure what Karma will do when he finds you. But there has been a few cases reported.
          One young lady said that Karma got back at her by pushing her down a flight of stairs right before she was to go on vacation.
          She said that she deserved it for lying to her boss and taking a coworkers days off. Her boss and coworkers are not happy with her, but I think Karma repaid them well.</p> <br>
